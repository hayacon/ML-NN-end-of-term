    "This project follows the universal workflow of machine learning from DLWP 4.5 (p.111). <br>\n",
    "Based on this workflow, the project first needs to define the problem and assembling the dataset. The problem that this project trying to solve is the multiclass image classification of fashion items.\n",
    "This project will develop the ML model that will classify the type of fashion item. The inputs to the model will be the image of a fashion item and the output will be the type or label of a fashion item such as trousers or dress.\n",
    "This project will be using the dataset \"fashion_mnist\"(https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist) from TensorFlow Dataset.  When building an ML model, there are few problems that I need to be aware of. One example is nonstationary problems can occur when a model is trying to predict something dependent on the season. For example, making fashion recommendations for winter based on the data from August will not work. However, the problem for this project is stationary and nonstationary problems will not apply. "

Therefore, I can hypothesize that my output can be predicted from the input which is the image of a fashion item and the dataset is informative enough for the model to learn relationships between inputs image and output label.<br>\n",
